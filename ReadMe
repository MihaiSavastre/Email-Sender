The main file is Automatic Report Sender, where scheduling is dealt with.

ClientReportService deals with reading the clients from file (simplest implementation, unlikely to be used in a real
scenario) and generates new reports for a given date (normally, current day). I left an old implementation there, in
case need for it arises. It simply generates a reports for all clients for a given list of days. Can be disregarded.

Ideally, the function generating reports would simply retrieve them from a directory where a different program
created them, or call a different program to generate them.

EmailService setups the email connection, constructs the email and sends the emails. There seem to be some issues
with attachments. They get sent, but aren't properly recognized in Gmail or Windows. The method used does simply copy
the contents of the report and puts them in the attachment. Perhaps there is a way to send the file directly, which
may solve this issue, but I have not found it.

For testing purposes, clients can be added to the Clients file using the "Name, Email" format and the necessary reports
will be generated when daily_task is run. The entries I have contain invalid email addresses, but I confirmed emails get
send to real addresses.

Thank you very much for your time!
